        <p> this is a good opportunity to present themselves in an interesting and individual light. Do not overburden your reader with too many details but pay attention to an adequate length. Avoid phrases and be specific in what you write. Above all, a smart sense of humor is well received, while fake ones and lies are less. Entice your reader with a question or a quote out of his reserve. You will see: it is well worth the effort.</p>
